        According to Hindu mythology, Hanuman was born to Anjana, a celestial
        nymph, and Kesari, a monkey king. Hanuman is also said to be the son of
        the wind god, Vayu, who played a vital role in his birth. Legend says
        that Anjana prayed to Lord Shiva for a child, and as a result, she was
        blessed with Hanuman. Vayu, the god of wind, also transferred some of
        his divine powers to Hanuman when Lord Shivaâ€™s blessings were granted.
        Born with immense strength and extraordinary abilities, Hanuman was
        destined to become one of the greatest devotees of Lord Ram and play a
        key role in the Ramayana.
